# RmiChatApp
Chat application in Java using RMI(Remote Method Invocation) API, This was one of my three assingments for Advance Programming course in Fast-LHR (2017)

Steps to run:
- Create Stub (Already created in out/production/RmiChatApp!)
- in cmd -> rmiregistry 6666
- run server -> java Server
- run client(s) -> java Client

Here's the screenshot of Rmi-Chat-App:

P.S A client needs to first connect to the server using "menu" option before sending any messages or joining chat.

I mostly use Netbeans IDE for Java applications/projects but for this one I used Intellij IDEA IDE (2017.2.5)
